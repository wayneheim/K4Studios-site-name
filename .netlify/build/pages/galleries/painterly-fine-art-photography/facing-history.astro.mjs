  //Facing History
  {
    q: "What is the Facing History collection?",
    a: [
      "Facing History is a painterly fine art series by Wayne Heim that explores America’s past through evocative portraits and scenes from pivotal eras — including the Civil War, World War II, and the Roaring 20s.",
      "Each image is designed to feel like a cinematic still or a chapter from a forgotten novel — deeply researched, emotionally grounded, and printed for collectors who tip their hat to history."
    ]
  },
  {
    q: "Are the people in these portraits real or imagined?",
    a: [
      "Every subject is real — often historical reenactors or living historians who understand the nuance of the time period they portray.",
      "This authenticity gives the Facing History series its depth. These aren’t costumed models — they’re storytellers in their own right."
    ]
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from traditional historical photography?",
    a: [
      "Wayne’s painterly style bridges art and realism. These aren’t sepia-toned snapshots or digitally aged filters. They're built from the ground up with layered textures, controlled lighting, and post-production techniques rooted in both traditional art and modern photography.",
      "The result feels timeless — like something between a painting and a dream."
    ]
  },
  {
    q: "Can I order prints from the Civil War, WWII, or Roaring 20s collections?",
    a: [
      "Yes. All themed galleries within Facing History offer collector-grade prints — available in archival paper, aluminum, and wood-mounted Engrained Series formats."
    ]
  },
  {
    q: "What makes the Engrained Series unique for historical prints?",
    a: [
      "The Engrained Series uses a proprietary UV printing method that allows the natural wood grain to show through selectively. This tactile, vintage-inspired approach works beautifully with historic imagery, lending each print warmth and soul."
    ]
  },
  {
    q: "Where are these images typically displayed?",
    a: [
      "Facing History prints are ideal for:",
      "<ul>\n  <li>Historic homes, libraries, or heritage hotels</li>\n  <li>Curated museum exhibits or galleries</li>\n  <li>Collectors of Americana or military art</li>\n  <li>Interior designers looking for meaningful conversation pieces</li>\n</ul>",
      "Wayne also works with hospitality and design firms to create custom-size installations."
    ]
  },
  {
    q: "Can I request a custom portrait in this style?",
    a: [
      "Wayne occasionally collaborates with individuals and historical societies to create custom portraits in the painterly Facing History style.",
      "If you have a story to tell — whether it's family heritage, military tribute, or a reenactment project — reach out to explore a commission."
