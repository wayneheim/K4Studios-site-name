    paragraphs: [
      `Historical reenactments have a long, rich lineage—stretching back at least to Roman times, when epic battles were restaged in vast amphitheaters for the public to witness. Today’s living history events continue that impulse to make the past present, giving audiences a visceral, multi-sensory way to learn and remember.`

    subhead: "What a Reenactment Looks Like Today",
    paragraphs: [
      `Modern reenactments are typically public events where living historians (often called reenactors) present both scripted and unscripted scenarios. Programs are usually organized around key timeframes, battles, or themes—mixing choreographed mock engagements with camp life, static displays, and hands-on demonstrations.`

    subhead: "Reenactors = Living Historians",
    paragraphs: [
      `Reenactors portray historical characters—sometimes specific figures like Abraham Lincoln, sometimes representative roles like a nurse, tanker, or infantryman. Like the Romans, many events still feature elaborately choreographed battle sequences, but the quiet details matter just as much: uniforms, tools, weapons, rations, drill, and daily routines.`

    paragraphs: [
      `Most reenactors are amateur historians in the best sense—deeply researched, obsessively accurate, and generous with knowledge. Wardrobe, how it’s worn, what’s eaten, unit structure, timelines, numbers involved, even the weather on a given date—all of it informs the portrayal. The goal is faithful representation without turning people into museum pieces.`

      `Kits are assembled from original pieces when available, or from high-quality reproductions. The spectrum runs from “close enough for ambiance” to museum-grade reproduction down to weave, stitch, and hardware. If you’re looking for authentic WWII gear, <a href="https://www.atthefront.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">At The Front</a> is a respected supplier of reproduction and original items.`

      `Because there are things a book—or even YouTube—can’t give you: the concussion of a tank firing, the sulfur bite of black powder, the cadence of commands drifting across a field. Reenactments turn history into experience, and they’re fantastic for getting kids (and adults) excited about the past.`

    list: [
      `Be respectful. Reenactors are approachable, but try not to interrupt in-character moments or safety briefings.`,
      `Be sensitive to “villain” portrayals. Some roles are sensitive; when in doubt, ask before photographing.`,
      `Work at a distance. A short telephoto (e.g., 80–200mm) lets you capture natural moments without changing behavior.`,
      `Use depth of field creatively. Shallow DOF echoes period optics and isolates your subject for a more “period-correct” feel.`,
      `Frame for story. Before you press the shutter, ask: “What’s the story in this picture?”`
