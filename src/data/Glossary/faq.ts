    q: "What is a historical reenactment (and why does it matter)?",
    a: [
      "A historical reenactment is living history—participants restage moments from the past so audiences can see, hear, and feel them in real time. It blends research, material culture, and performance to turn history into experience."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "What’s the difference between a reenactor and a living historian?",
    a: [
      "They’re often the same people. “Reenactor” highlights the performance; “living historian” emphasizes the research and teaching. Both roles aim for accurate representation—from clothing and tools to drill, rations, and routines."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "What happens at a typical event?",
    a: [
      "You’ll find scripted battle demonstrations and unscripted camp life, plus static displays, talks, and hands-on demos. Many events organize the weekend around a specific battle, era, or theme so visitors can follow the story through time."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Are reenactments family-friendly?",
    a: [
      "Yes—most are designed for the public. Expect educational talks, museum-style exhibits, and plenty of opportunities to ask questions. Check each event’s schedule for age-appropriate programs and loud-noise advisories."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "How authentic is the gear—and where do reenactors get it?",
    a: [
      "Kits range from solid “close enough” to museum-grade reproductions down to the weave and stitching. Originals are used when available and safe. For WWII gear, a trusted source is <a href=\"https://www.atthefront.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">At The Front</a>."

  {
    q: "How do I find events near me?",
    a: [
      "Start with known anchor events, then search locally by era (e.g., “Civil War reenactment near me”). A few popular, public events that I’ve photographed:",

    q: "What’s the etiquette for photographing reenactors?",
    a: [
      `<ul>
        <li><strong>Be respectful:</strong> Avoid interrupting in-character moments or safety briefings.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask when unsure:</strong> Some “villain” portrayals or sensitive roles may prefer not to be photographed.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t cross ropes or lines:</strong> Follow staff and unit instructions at all times.</li>
        <li><strong>Share, credit, repeat:</strong> If you post images, credit the event/unit when possible.</li>
      </ul>`

  {
    q: "What camera gear works best at reenactments?",
    a: [
      "A short telephoto zoom (70–200mm or 80–200mm) lets you work at a respectful distance and capture candid moments. Add a fast prime for low light and a lens hood to cut flare. Pack extra batteries/cards—and consider ear protection for blank-fire demonstrations."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Should I use shallow depth of field to get a more period look?",
    a: [
      "Often, yes. A shallower DOF can echo characteristics of vintage lenses and helps isolate your subject from modern distractions. Use it deliberately to support the story you’re telling."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Can I pose reenactors for portraits?",
    a: [
      "Usually—just ask. Many living historians are happy to help if it doesn’t disrupt programming. Be quick, keep directions simple, and let them stay in character. If a role is sensitive, accept a polite no."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Can I sell or license photos taken at reenactments?",
    a: [
      "Policies vary by event. Some allow editorial and portfolio use; commercial licensing may require permission, a media pass, or location/model releases. Always review event rules and coordinate with organizers before you publish commercially."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Any safety considerations for visitors and photographers?",
    a: [
      "Absolutely. Treat all weapons and vehicles as if they are live. Obey rope lines and marshals, stay out of engagement zones, and mind muzzle direction during blank-fire demos. Ear/eye protection is wise around artillery, armor, or close volleys."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Where can I see examples of reenactment images?",
    a: [
      "Browse my living-history work throughout the site—Civil War, WWII, Wild West, and more—shot candidly and in environmental portrait style. Each gallery focuses on storytelling as much as spectacle."
