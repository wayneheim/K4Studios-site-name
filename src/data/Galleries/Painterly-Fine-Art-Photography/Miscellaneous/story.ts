    paragraphs: [
      `Some images don’t belong to a time or place — they belong to a feeling. This gallery gathers those portraits and painterly moments that resist easy classification. Here, Wayne Heim captures the in-between: expressions that linger, gestures caught mid-thought, and stories that unfold without a script.`,
      `Blending classical fine art portraiture with a distinctly painterly sensibility, this collection offers a quiet defiance of traditional categories. Each image is rendered with a depth of tone and light that invites longer looks and deeper contemplation — a study in nuance, mood, and narrative.`

    subhead: "Solo Studies – Portraits That Hold a Gaze",
    paragraphs: [
      `These are the faces that stay with you. Each solo portrait in this series distills a moment of introspection, resolve, or wonder. Whether it's the light catching just so across a cheekbone or the tension in a single hand, these portraits don’t just show the subject — they reveal them.`,
      `Rendered in Wayne’s painterly style, these images feel timeless, almost classical. The brush of light across skin, the softness of background textures, and the contemplative atmosphere bring to mind museum portraits — but rooted in real, present-day emotion.`

    subhead: "Figures in Focus – More Than a Setting",
    paragraphs: [
      `These portraits draw the eye inward, toward the person rather than the place. Even when framed in dramatic landscapes or vintage interiors, the subject remains front and center — an anchor in the composition.`,
      `This series is about essence: posture, expression, and mood. Each figure is shaped by their environment but not defined by it. The painterly touch adds depth and texture, turning each frame into a character study.`

    subhead: "Painterly Bride & Groom – Moments of Connection",
    paragraphs: [
      `Not wedding photography — but something more enduring. These images focus on the emotional resonance between two people, capturing love in quiet, unscripted forms. A shared glance. A breath held.`,
      `Presented in Wayne’s painterly approach, these portraits transcend the event. They become heirlooms — artistic representations of commitment and tenderness, frozen in time yet alive with meaning.`

    subhead: "EMiscellaneous Moments – Candid Meets Crafted",
       paragraphs: [
       `Some images exist purely because the moment was too good to pass up. This is where spontaneity and artistic discipline meet. Children laughing off-frame, a reenactor adjusting a costume in the quiet between scenes, a pair of boots left under a church pew.`,
      `These images may not fit a single category, but they hold space in the broader story. They’re the connective tissue between galleries — proof that artistry can thrive in the unscripted, the overlooked, and the almost-missed.`

    subhead: "Where Narrative and Nuance Collide",
    paragraphs: [
      `This gallery serves as a creative crossroads. It’s where the fine art portrait meets the fleeting glance — where traditional techniques collide with modern sensibility. For collectors and viewers alike, it offers a deeper exploration of Wayne Heim’s painterly voice outside thematic constraints.`,
      `Whether you’re drawn to the technical mastery of light and texture or the emotional pull of unscripted moments, you’ll find something here that resonates. These are images that don’t just show — they say something.`
