    q: "What makes your portrait photography 'painterly'?",
    a: [
      "Wayne Heim’s painterly portraits combine fine art sensibility with masterful photographic technique. Through tonal layering, softened edges, and deliberate lighting, each image evokes the mood and atmosphere of a classical oil painting — while staying rooted in real emotion."
    ]
  },
  {
    q: "Are these posed or candid portraits?",
    a: [
      "Both. Some portraits are carefully composed — intimate studies or figures in dramatic light — while others are captured in quiet, unguarded moments. Wayne’s painterly process brings a timeless quality to each image, whether staged or spontaneous."
    ]
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a unifying theme in this gallery?",
    a: [
      `Not a single theme — but a shared feeling. This gallery collects portraits and painterly moments that don’t belong to a specific historical or narrative set, but still resonate deeply. Solitude, love, grace, introspection… these are the emotional threads tying it all together.`
    ]
  },
  {
    q: "What kinds of subjects are featured in the 'Miscellaneous' category?",
    a: [
      "You’ll find everything from children and couples to thoughtful individuals and expressive characters. Some images are quiet meditations on mood; others capture fleeting gestures or beautifully imperfect slices of life — all shaped through Wayne’s artistic lens."
    ]
  },
  {
    q: "Can I purchase prints from this collection?",
    a: [
      `Absolutely. Every image in this gallery is available as a fine art print. Choose from archival paper, canvas, or Wayne’s signature <a href="/Other/K4-Select-Series/Engrained">Engrained wood-mounted prints</a>.`
    ]
  },
  {
    q: "How does this differ from the historical portrait galleries?",
    a: [
      `While the <a href="/Galleries/Painterly-Fine-Art-Photography/Facing-History">Facing History</a> series is rooted in period reenactments and historical storytelling, the portraits here are more fluid — contemporary, personal, and emotionally intuitive. They may echo the past in style, but their spirit is firmly in the present.`

  {
    q: "Is this collection still growing?",
    a: [
      "Yes. This gallery is an evolving visual journal — a space for new discoveries, spontaneous portraits, and moments that don’t fit neatly into other collections. It grows as Wayne encounters people, moods, and stories that deserve to be remembered."

    q: "Where should I go next if I love this painterly portrait style?",
    a: [
