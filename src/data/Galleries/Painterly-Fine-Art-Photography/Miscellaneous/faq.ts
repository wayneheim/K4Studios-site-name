    q: "What makes your transportation photography 'painterly'?",
    a: [
      "Wayne Heim’s painterly portraits combine fine art sensibility with masterful photographic technique. Using tonal layering, softened edges, and deliberate lighting, each image mimics the depth and atmosphere of a classical oil painting — all while remaining grounded in reality."
    ]
  },
  {
    q: "Are these posed or candid portraits?",
    a: [
       "This gallery blends both. Some portraits are composed with intention — solo studies and figures in focus — while others are captured in quiet, authentic moments. Wayne’s painterly touch lends them all a timeless quality, whether scripted or spontaneous."

  {
    q: "DHow does this gallery differ from your historical portraits?",

    a: [
      "Yes. This gallery evolves as Wayne encounters new people, moods, and scenes that don’t fit neatly elsewhere. It’s an ever-expanding visual journal of the unexpected — a home for moments that move us without needing to explain why."
