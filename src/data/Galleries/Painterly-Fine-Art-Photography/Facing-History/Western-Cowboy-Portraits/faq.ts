    q: "What makes Wayne Heim's cowboy art prints different from typical Western photography?",
    a: [
      `Wayne blends painterly photo techniques with decades of artistic training to create imagery that feels more like a story than a snapshot. As both an <a href="https://heimmedicalart.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">award-winning medical illustrator</a> and fine art photographer, he brings a rare mix of anatomical precision, lighting expertise, and narrative instinct to every portrait.`,
      `These aren't filters or digital gimmicks — each image is built through intentional post-processing, rooted in <strong>historical research</strong> and designed to evoke the emotional texture of <a href="/Galleries/Painterly-Fine-Art-Photography/Facing-History/Western-Cowboy-Portraits">classic cowboy art</a>.`,

  {
