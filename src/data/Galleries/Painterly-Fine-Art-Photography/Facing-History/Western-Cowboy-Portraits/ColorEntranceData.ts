  title: "Cowboy Art Prints by Wayne Heim - Authentic Western Fine Art Photography in Color",
  subtitle: "Capturing the Spirit of the American West",
  description:
    "Discover a painterly take on cowboy photography that brings the color and grit of the frontier to life. Wayne Heim's Western art prints are more than portraits — they are vivid stories etched in sun, shadow, and dust.",
  details:
    "These color cowboy photographs are captured with the soul of the American West in mind—no studio backdrops, no Hollywood tropes. Just real cowboys, historic reenactors, and the spirit of wide-open spaces. Printed using painterly techniques, these works blend the realism of photography with the brushlike textures of illustration.",
