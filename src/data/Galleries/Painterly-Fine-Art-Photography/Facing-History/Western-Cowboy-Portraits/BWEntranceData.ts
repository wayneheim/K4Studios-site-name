  title: "Cowboy Art Prints by Wayne Heim - Authentic Western Fine Art Photography in Black and White",
  subtitle: "Capturing the Spirit of the Old American West",
  description:
    "Discover a painterly take on cowboy photography that brings the black and white tones and the grit of the frontier to life. Wayne Heim's Western art prints are more than portraits — they are vivid stories seasoned in the sun, shadow, and dust of the West.",
  details:
    "These black and white cowboy photographs are captured with the soul of the American West in mind—no studio backdrops, no Hollywood tropes. Just real cowboys, historic reenactors, and the spirit of wide-open spaces. Developed using Wayne's painterly photographic techniques, these works blend the realism of photography with the brushlike textures of illustration and fine art painting.",
