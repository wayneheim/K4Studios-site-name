    q: "What makes Wayne Heim’s Roaring 20s portraits different from other 1920s photography?",
    a: [
      `Wayne’s painterly fine art photography doesn’t glamorize the Jazz Age — it captures its grit. As an <a href="https://heimmedicalart.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">award-winning medical illustrator</a> and fine art photographer, Wayne uses a mix of historical research, lighting mastery, and narrative instinct to create portraits that feel like cinematic stills rather than posed reenactments.`,
