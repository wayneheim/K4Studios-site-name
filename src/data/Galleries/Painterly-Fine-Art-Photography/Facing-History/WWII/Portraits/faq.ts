As an <a href="https://heimmedicalart.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">award-winning medical illustrator</a> and fine art photographer, Wayne blends period-accurate research, creative lighting, and a cinematic painterly process to create images that feel like lost movie stills rather than standard reenactment photos.`,
