  description:
    "Explore painterly international landscape photography by Wayne Heim, featuring evocative scenes from Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Canadian coastlines, and other breathtaking locations around the world. These painterly fine art prints transform remote and wild places into moody, textured visual narratives — perfect for collectors, interior designers, and nature lovers with a global eye.",
  details:
    "Wayne Heim’s international landscape photography blends fine art aesthetics with world-travelled perspective. Each piece captures the atmosphere of untamed regions — from Iceland’s volcanic valleys and waterfalls, to fog-draped cliffs in the Faroes, to the rocky coasts of Newfoundland and windswept European countrysides. These painterly photographs are ideal for collectors of global fine art, rustic or modern interiors, and anyone who seeks distant beauty reimagined through the eye of an artist. Available on wood, acrylic, metal, and archival paper.",
