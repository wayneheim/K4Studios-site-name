  details:
    "Wayne Heim’s Western landscape photography fuses fine art mastery with the raw grandeur of the American West. Each image captures the spirit of legendary regions—towering peaks of the Rocky Mountains and Mountain West, sunlit canyons of Arizona and Utah, wildflower meadows of Colorado, and sweeping ranchlands of Wyoming and Montana. You’ll find moody vistas from Jackson Hole, the Big Sky Country of Montana, and the iconic buttes of Monument Valley. From the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone to the red-rock wonders and desert skies, these painterly photographs celebrate the untamed beauty and history of the West. Perfect for collectors of Western art, home decorators seeking rustic or modern wall art, and anyone inspired by the vastness of America’s frontier. Available as wood, acrylic, metal, or archival paper prints.",
