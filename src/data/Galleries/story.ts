    title: "Painterly Fine Art Photography: Where Photography Meets Painting",
    paragraphs: [
      `What is painterly photography? It’s more than a technique—it’s a philosophy. Rooted in the tradition of the Pictorialist movement, painterly photography bridges the gap between fine art and photographic realism. By blending the expressive techniques of painting—such as soft focus, dramatic lighting, and rich textures—with the precision of high-end photographic capture, it creates images that feel timeless, emotive, and visually immersive.`,
      `For award-winning fine art photographer and medical illustrator Wayne Heim, painterly photography is a way to transform everyday moments into lasting visual narratives. Each image is carefully composed and crafted to do more than document—it invites you to step into another place and time. Whether it's a fog-draped battlefield, a Western saloon, or a forgotten road, these pieces blur the line between memory and imagination. It's storytelling through light, shadow, and texture.`
