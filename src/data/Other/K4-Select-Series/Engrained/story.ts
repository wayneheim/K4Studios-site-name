Each piece is printed on hand-selected ½-inch Baltic Birch wood panels, where the natural grain becomes part of the composition. <strong>Wayne Heim’s work employs a custom 5-layer printing technique that fuses each image into the wood itself</strong>, creating a visual and tactile dialogue between image and material.`,

    paragraphs: [
      `This isn’t mass production. <strong>Wayne Heim’s 5-layer UV process</strong> carefully balances ink and transparency to create visual harmony. Unlike conventional wood prints that flatten or overpower with white ink, this method invites the wood into the story. White is added or withheld where needed, letting the natural grain participate in the final piece.`,
