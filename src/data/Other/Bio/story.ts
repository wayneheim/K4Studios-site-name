      "Welcome to K4 Studios. I’m Wayne Heim—an award-winning fine art photographer and nationally recognized medical illustrator whose work spans from the operating room to the open range. But titles don’t matter if the work doesn’t speak. And mine isn’t here to impress. It’s here to haunt.",
      "I don’t shoot moments. I shoot meaning. Not the kind found in perfect light or flawless exposure, but in the tension between clarity and ambiguity—between what happened, and what might’ve."

    subhead: "The Painterly Philosophy",
    paragraphs: [
      "My work lives between mediums—too painterly for traditional photographers, too photographic for purists. And I’m fine with that. I’m not here to chase perfection or fidelity. I’m here to tell stories. Some of those stories live in the blur, in the breath between frames, in the imperfections that make a memory feel real.",
      "This is the legacy of pictorialism—not surface effects, but mood, structure, and emotional residue. I sculpt my images like an illustrator builds form: layer by layer, in search of narrative gravity.",
      "Where others mimic painterly style, I define it through restraint. Through what’s left unsaid."

    subhead: "What Illustration Taught Me About Photography",
    paragraphs: [
      "As a medical illustrator, I was trained to distill complex information into clarity—to emphasize what matters, eliminate what doesn’t, and guide the eye through a story of function, purpose, and life.",
      "That same principle drives my painterly photography: remove distraction. Control the frame. Tell the story without saying a word too many.",
      "In both disciplines, story is king. And when you cut away the noise, what’s left is what you were meant to feel all along."

    subhead: "The Medium Is Not the Message",
    paragraphs: [
      "I’ve spent enough time in the worlds of science, art, and reenactment to know this: tools don’t make the vision. They can either get in the way—or get out of it. My cameras are chosen to disappear behind the narrative.",
      "Great pictures don’t matter. The story does. If you walk away thinking 'nice photo,' I’ve failed. I want you to feel like you’ve stepped into a memory you don’t quite recall, or a history you somehow lived."

    paragraphs: [
      "From storm-battered landscapes to Western outlaws and Civil War widows, every subject I shoot is a vessel for something larger: memory, myth, the echoes of unspoken stories.",
      "This site isn’t a portfolio. It’s a conversation. A slow turn through lives half-remembered. A photo-narrative anthology where every frame is a page torn from a book that never got written.",
      "Some viewers walk away with admiration. Others walk away unsettled. I’m not aiming for applause. I’m aiming for resonance. If you remember nothing else, remember this...",
