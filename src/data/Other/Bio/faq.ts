    q: "What makes the Engrained Series different from standard wood prints?",
    a: [
      "Standard wood prints are typically uniform — a single layer of ink sits on top of the board. With the Engrained Series, Wayne Heim uses a proprietary 5-layer UV process where the white underlayer is selectively controlled.",
      "This allows portions of the image to become translucent, letting the wood’s natural grain show through like a painter’s brushstroke. It’s textured, intentional, and completely unique to each piece."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Is each piece one-of-a-kind?",
    a: [
      "Yes. Because the wood grain is never identical — and because Wayne adjusts print density, tone, and detail individually — no two prints are exactly the same.",
      "Each image is printed with care and reviewed for balance between subject, texture, and tone before being approved as part of the Engrained collection."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "What types of subjects work best for Engrained?",
    a: [
      "Wayne selects subjects that harmonize with wood: weathered cowboy portraits, antique cars, Civil War moments, and wide Western skies all lend themselves beautifully to the format.",
      "The depth of the grain enhances the timeless mood of the image — turning photography into something tactile and deeply rooted."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Are these available in limited editions?",
    a: [
      "Most Engrained prints are offered in small, signed editions or as one-off collector pieces.",
      "Wayne believes this process should remain personal, not mass-produced. Custom sizes or commissions may be available depending on subject and timing."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "How are they mounted or framed?",
    a: [
      "Engrained prints are mounted on cradled birch panels, ready to hang. Optional barnwood framing is available and complements the rustic, historical tone of the work.",
      "No glass or acrylic covers the print — it’s a raw, tactile presentation that lets the material speak."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Can I request a custom image as part of the Engrained series?",
    a: [
      "Yes. Wayne occasionally takes on commissions if the subject fits the spirit of the series — historical, weathered, rooted in story.",
      "Contact him directly if you have a portrait, heirloom, or visual concept you’d like to see brought to life on wood."

  {
    q: "Where do collectors typically display these pieces?",
    a: [
      "Engrained prints are often found in:",
      "<ul>\n  <li>Cabins, ranches, or rustic homes</li>\n  <li>Americana-themed restaurants or hotel lobbies</li>\n  <li>Offices with character and story</li>\n  <li>Collector galleries with a focus on Western or vintage themes</li>\n</ul>",
      "Each piece becomes a conversation starter — part artwork, part artifact."
