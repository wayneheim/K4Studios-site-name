    q: "What makes Wayne Heim’s photography different from others in the genre?",
    a: [
      "Wayne’s work isn’t just about the subject — it’s about the **story** behind the subject. His painterly fine art photography fuses narrative, historical context, and emotional tone into each frame.",
      "While many capture what is, Wayne crafts what could have been. He treats each image like a scene from a forgotten film or an unwritten novel, built with the intention of making the viewer wonder: *Who were they? What happened here?*"
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "What’s Wayne’s background in art and illustration?",
    a: [
      "Wayne is an **award-winning medical illustrator** with a BFA from the Cleveland Institute of Art. He’s spent decades distilling anatomy and surgical detail into visuals for doctors and patients — a world where accuracy is everything and storytelling saves lives.",
      "That background taught him discipline, lighting, and visual hierarchy — all of which now inform his painterly photography. It’s a rare blend of scientific precision and artistic instinct."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Is Wayne classically trained in photography?",
    a: [
      "Yes — but he doesn’t stay in the box. Wayne trained in traditional photography, darkroom technique, and visual composition before transitioning to modern digital tools.",
      "He uses the best of both worlds: classical structure and cutting-edge control. Whether sculpting light through digital layers or echoing pictorialist texture, his work nods to the past while breaking open the future."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Does Wayne use AI or preset filters in his work?",
    a: [
      "No. Every image is hand-tuned — layer by layer, choice by choice. Wayne doesn’t believe in automated shortcuts. Instead, he builds tone, texture, and meaning through a painter’s mindset.",
      "His imagery is deeply rooted in **craft, not code**. The results are timeless — not trend-driven."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "How does storytelling shape Wayne’s approach to photography?",
    a: [
      "For Wayne, storytelling is the **center of everything**. He approaches each shoot like a scene from a film or a lost page in a history book. Whether he’s photographing a re-enactor, a lone landscape, or a silent machine, there’s always a narrative thread beneath the surface.",
      "Like great musicians — think Billy Joel or Rod Stewart — who built careers as **lyric storytellers**, Wayne uses imagery to tell stories that stick. His photography doesn’t just show — it invites the viewer to feel, to imagine, and to remember."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Is this style of painterly photography common?",
    a: [
      "Not at this level of depth. While others may add painterly 'effects,' Wayne’s work is grounded in a full **philosophy** — pulling from classical illustration, pictorialist photography, and narrative filmmaking.",
      "He’s constantly asking not just *What can I do with this tool?* but *What hasn’t been done yet?* It’s this push — this refusal to settle — that makes the work original, emotional, and enduring."
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Why does history play such a big role in his work?",
    a: [
      "History holds power — not just as fact, but as feeling. Wayne is drawn to historical subjects because they offer resonance, humanity, and mystery.",
      "Many of the images in his series feel like echoes from a forgotten time. Some are recreations. Some are reinterpretations. All are rooted in **respect for the past** and a fascination with how its stories still shape us today.",
      "As Wayne often says: *Sometimes old becomes new again.*"
