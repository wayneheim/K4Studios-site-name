    q: "What’s the difference between painterly and traditional fine art photography?",

      "Traditional fine art photography, on the other hand, embraces crisp clarity and natural lighting, capturing the world with documentary precision while still rooted in artistic intent.",

        <li><strong>Traditional Fine Art:</strong> Natural landscapes, wildlife, architecture, and candid portraits, all captured with clarity and a deep respect for place and story.</li>
      </ul>`,
